# This script runs the end-to-end tests for the kn client.

# If you already have the `KO_DOCKER_REPO` environment variable set and a
# cluster setup and currently selected in your kubeconfig, call the script
# with the `--run-tests` argument and it will use the cluster and run the tests.

# Calling this script without arguments will create a new cluster in
# project $PROJECT_ID, start Knative serving, run the tests and delete
# the cluster.

# If you call this script after configuring the environment variable
# $KNATIVE_VERSION with a valid release, e.g. 0.6.0, Knative serving
# of this specified version will be installed in the Kubernetes cluster, and
# all the tests will run against Knative serving of this specific version.
