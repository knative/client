# Traffic Splitting

kn can help you control which revisions get traffic in your Knative Service.

A Knative Service has a traffic mapping, which is a mapping of revisions of the
Service to percent amounts of traffic, along with the ability to create unique
URLs for particular revisions. It also has the ability to assign traffic to the
latest Revision, which can change as new revisions are created.
