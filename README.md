The Knative client `kn` is your door to the [Knative](https://knative.dev)
world. It allows you to create Knative resources interactively from the command
line or from within scripts.

`kn` offers you:

- Full support for managing all features of
  [Knative Serving](https://github.com/knative/serving) (services, revisions,
  traffic splits)
- Growing support for [Knative eventing](https://github.com/knative/eventing),
  closely following its development (managing of sources & triggers)
- A plugin architecture similar to that of `kubectl` plugins
- A thin client-specific API in golang which helps with tasks like synchronously
  waiting on Knative service write operations.
- An easy integration of Knative into Tekton Pipelines by using
  [`kn` in a Tekton `Task`](https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/tree/master/task/kn).


This client uses the
[Knative Serving](https://github.com/knative/docs/blob/main/docs/serving/spec/knative-api-specification-1.0.md)
and
[Knative Eventing](https://github.com/knative/eventing/tree/main/docs/spec)
APIs exclusively so that it will work with any Knative installation, even those
that are not Kubernetes based. It does not help with _installing_ Knative itself
though. Please refer to the various
[Knative installation options](https://knative.dev/docs/install/) for how to
install Knative with its prerequisites.
